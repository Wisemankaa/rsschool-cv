### About myself:

Programming is my hobby, for now.

I have a huge experience in IT (administration and management).

All my life I've been programming on whatever and wherever it was possible, so in general I estimate my programming experience as average.

All the software products were created either for myself, or for very limited use as a commercial product. I myself was the customer, problem setter and programmer of these products.

Therefore I estimate the experience in commercial programming as very small.

I want to become a professional software architect.

For this I lack experience in commercial programming - which is what I'm trying to get now.
